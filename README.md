# AaaS
Animal as a Service is a web application built using Docker, Flask, Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript, and the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Search API. The app is primarily a testing ground for different technologies that I am interested in. A zookeeper AI chatbot will be added next. 

I began by using Flask/Python for the web framework. The animal image URLs are from the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Search API where I look for animals that fit a parameter that I set using Azure's tools. I used Bootstrap for the styling. The application is live on an AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance running in a Docker container.
